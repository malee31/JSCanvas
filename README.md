# What is this?
JSCanvas is a library made to make using the HTML canvas for animations, drawings, and games easier using only pure JavaScript.  
It can be used in static pages and is easy to set up and use.  
[Check out the demos to see what it can do!](https://malee31.github.io/JSCanvas/docs/)  

# How to add JSCanvas to your project
To use the library, add a script tag for it before your own scripts to load it.  
Copy the following files or use a cdn to add the scripts to your projects:  
- JSCanvas.js (For basic one-off drawings)  
- JSMemoryCanvas.js (For redrawing abilities and input feeding)
